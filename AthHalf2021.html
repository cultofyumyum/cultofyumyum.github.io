	<h2>Training My Ath Off</h2>
<br>
	<p>
		In May of 2021 I decided to challenge myself by running the Athens Half Marathon. Having dabbled in running before I never quite found it as something I could or would be able to do consistently. Equipped with an old pair of Adidas shoes and my Garmin watch I signed up for the race in May, five and a half months out from race time.
		<br>
		I had two particular goals in mind as I began to prepare:<br>
		<ul class="b">
				<li>Finish the damn race.</li>
				<li>Finish in 131 minutes (Average a 10 mile pace).</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		And thus began my summer of discontent. <del>After procrastinating for 6 weeks</del> In order to survive I knew I was going to need to set up a training plan. A magnificent resource for me was the <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Novice-1-Half-Marathon-Printable.pdf">Hal Higdon Novice 1 Half Marathon Training Plan</a>. This plan appealed to me because it allowed me to run shorter runs during the weekdays and really push myself in small, incremental steps at each weekend. Instead of trying to "go hard or go home" every run I now had a framework of pushing myself 2-3 times during the weekday, followed by an incremental increase every weekend up until race day.
		<br><br>
		The three major tenets that I stuck to while training were:

	<h3>Run More Slowly</h3>
		Anytime I ran previously I would try to sprint my way to a Personal Record (PR) every single time. This would lead me to crash and burn after about 3 miles. But hey, I figured I would never need or have to run more than a 5k up until now. Learning how to slow down was absolutely crucial. It defitely took time to get used to running slower, but my Garmin watch was super helpful. Instead of keeping the watch face on my run stats of Time and Distance covered, I instead opted for a readout of my HeartRate. This allowed me to not only understand when I needed to slow down, but also what a more sustainable pace felt like. Over time I was able to stay in my optimum Heart Rate pace much more easily and naturally. This not only helped me push myself further distances but helped to vastly improve my times on my shorter runs during the weekdays.

	<h3>You only run as well as you cross-train</h3>
		When trying to run 150+ miles before my half marathon, cross-training was something that became absolutely crucial to my success. Each week in my training planned called for two days of cross-training, one on a day where I do a short run and another on a day with no run at all. A good cross-training session (at least to me) includes some good cardio and some form of strength training. The strenght training was incredibly important to me, since as a vegetarian creating muscle mass is already somewhat of a challenge. While by no means have I been getting yoked during this training I've been able to keep myself at somewhat of a stasis.<br><br>
		During ymday that I have to train but not run, I've taken up riding my bicycle. I'm almost as proud of this as the progress I've made running thus far. My bike has more or less collected dust the past two years, only seening a handful of rides. I've already taken it out mor ethis year than the entire time I owned it previously. It's been really great to have a cardiovascular activity that challenges my body differently from running with the added benefit of being incredibly low-impact on my knees and back.
